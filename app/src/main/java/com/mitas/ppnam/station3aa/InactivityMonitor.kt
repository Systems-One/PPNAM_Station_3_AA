/**
 * Inactivity auto sign-out timer (copied from Station 1). Pure Kotlin: the caller supplies a
 * monotonic clock and a scheduler, so production uses SystemClock.elapsedRealtime plus a
 * main-thread Handler while tests drive time by hand.
 *
 * The deadline is wall-clock from the last activity, so time spent in the background still
 * counts; hosts call [checkNow] on resume to catch a deadline that passed while no Handler was
 * running. [onExpired] fires at most once per [start].
